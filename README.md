# CCHIP8

CCHIP8 is a module for the [edra](https://github.com/solomonarul/edra) emulator, designed with simplicity and agnosticism first.

That means that it is incredibly simple to run it on your own by just creating your own CHIP8 context.

NOTE: There are no examples, for now use [edra's](https://github.com/solomonarul/edra/blob/main/inc/drivers/chip8.h) as a sample.
